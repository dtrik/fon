This is the [second lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MysNlmHtonc)

## Introduction

This is a short lecture focused on two important concepts that are required for understanding the
course.

### Density of States
Electrons can only exist in specific energy levels in materials. When it comes to solids, these
energy levels form almost continuous bands. It is therefore convenient to define a density of
states. This measures the number of states per unit energy. It is obtained experimentally.

### Fermi Function
At 0K, the Fermi Level separates the filled states in the energy diagram with the empty states.
All energy levels above the Fermi Level are empty and all states below the Fermi Level are
occupied. But when the temperature rises above 0K, then this is indicated by the Fermi Function.
It indicates, what fraction of the states are filled at each energy level. The Fermi Function is:
$f(E)= \frac{1}{1+e ^ \frac {E-\mu} {kT}}$

In the above, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature and E is the energy. $kT$ is
called the thermal energy and is a universal constant which is ~25 meV. In this scale, energy is
measured in meV.

The Fermi Function looks like this:

Coming back to the device, when the two contacts are at the same voltage, we refer to it as the
device being in equilibrium.
At this state, the picture would be like below:

Here we can see that the two contacts and the channel are at the same electrochemical potential. 

When a positive voltage is applied to the drain, the device is no longer in equilibrium. The
picture would be like below:

At this stage, the two contacts are shifted with respect to each other. Current flow happens in
the region around the Fermi Level where the source has a surplus of electrons while the drain
has a deficit. More details about current flow will be presented in future lessons. 

NB: Images are from the slides of the class. They are available at [nanoHUB](https://nanohub.org/courses/FON1). The classes are wonderful, I would highly recommend you go through them. Any
mistakes in content are mine.
