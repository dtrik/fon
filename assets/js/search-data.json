            "content": "This is the fourth lecture . In this lecture, we derive an expression for the overall conductance in terms of the Fermi Function and G(E) which is the conductance depending on the energy. . We start with the current formula derived in the previous lecture: . $I = frac{1}{q} int_{- infty}^{ infty} G(E) (f_1(E) - f_2(E)) dE$ . Here $f_1(E)$ and $f_2(E)$ are respectively, . $f_1(E) = f(E, mu _1) = frac{1}{1+ e ^ frac{E- mu _1}{kT}$ . $f_2(E) = f(E, mu _2) = frac{1}{1+ e ^ frac{E- mu _2}{kT}$ . Taking a short diversion, in the Fermi Function: $f(E) = frac{1}{1+ e ^ frac{E- mu}{kT}}$ . If we replace $ frac{E- mu}{kT}$ with $x$, we have: $f(x) = frac {1}{1+ e ^ x}$ . So, the partial derivative of $f(E)$ with respect to E is: $ frac{ partial f}{ partial E} = frac{ partial f}{ partial x} * frac{ partial x}{ partial E}$ . Similarly, the partial derivative of $f(E)$ with respect to $ mu$ is: $ frac{ partial f}{ partial mu} = frac{ partial f}{ partial x} * frac{ partial x}{ partial mu}$ . From, $x = frac {E- mu} {kT}$: . $ frac{ partial x}{ partial E} = frac {1}{kT}$, and $ frac{ partial x}{ partial mu}= - frac{1}{kT}$ . From the above two, we have the relation $ frac{ partial x}{ partial E} = - $ frac{ partial x}{ partial mu}$ . When $ mu _1$ and $ mu _2$ are close values, ie. for small V, from the Taylor series, we have: . $f(E, mu 1) - f(E, mu _2) approx ( frac{ partial f}{ partial mu}) mu _0 ( mu _1 - mu _2)$ . Reformulating this in terms of partial derivative of E, . $RHS = (- frac{ partial f}{ partial E})_ mu _0 ( mu _1 - mu _2)$ . Therefore, $I = frac{1}{q} int_{- infty}^{ infty} G(E) (- frac{ partial f}{ partial E})_ mu _0 ( mu _1 - mu _2) dE$ . $ mu _1 - mu _2 = qV$ . So, $I/V = int_{- infty}^{ infty} G(E) (- frac{ partial f}{ partial E})_ mu _0 dE$ . The above formula indicates that the measured conductance is an average of the conductance function. .",

            "content": "This is the third lecture . As discussed in the previous lecture, current only flows in a small energy window around the electrochemical potential. This happens because the source tries to fill the empty states it sees to bring it to equilibrium with itself while the drain tries to take it out to bring the channel to equilibrium with itself. Below the electrochemical potential, this differential is not there, so no electron transfer happens through those states. . We will now derive the conductance for two cases, first with the assumption that the density of states around the electrochemical potential is constant and next without the assumption. The first one gives us an approximate formula that we saw in the first lecture while the second one gives us the more general relation. . We start with this, which is true at steady state: . #electrons in channel = #electrons/second X time spent in channel . An analogy for this would be the number of PhDs in a university will be equal to the number of PhD that enter per year multiplied by the time taken to complete a PhD. For eg, consider that 50 new students enter a year, and on an average it takes 4 years to complete a PhD. This means, at steady state (once all the years are occupied), there are 200 PhD students in the university. . Returning to our conductance formula derivation, current $I$ when q is the charge of an electron and t is the time spent in the channel is: . charge of electron q * #electrons/second. . Therefore, #electrons/second = $ frac{I}{q}$ . We defined the density of states $D$ as the number of states per unit energy. With our assumption of constant energy around the electrochemical potential, the energy is $qV$. Therefore on average, we have $ frac{DqV}{2}$ electrons in the channel. We divide by 2 because one contact is trying to fill the energy level while the other is trying to empty it. So on an average, a state will be occupied half the time. . We have, . $ frac{DqV}{2} = frac{I}{q} t$ . Hence the conductance $G= frac{I}{V}$, . $ frac{I}{V} = frac{Dq^2}{2t}$ . Next we consider the general formula, without the assumption of uniform energy in the channel. Consider a small energy range dE with the energy D(E). The time spent in the channel is also a function of the energy. So going back to equation 1, the number of electrons in this tiny energy frame is: . $ frac{D(E)dE}{2} = frac{I}{q} t(E)$ . But the above assumes that the source is completely occupied around the Fermi Level while the drain is completely empty. This is not true in general. So to include the occupancy of the source and drain in our analysis, we have to multiply the LHS by $f_1(E) - f_2(E)$. This component takes into account the fact that current flow is due to the difference in the fermi functions of the two contacts. . So we have: . $ frac{D(E)dE}{2} (f_1(E) - f_2(E)) = frac{I}{q} t(E)$ . With our framework of an elastic resistor, the electron does not lose energy while moving through the channel. This ensures that the motion of electrons across different energy levels is independent. Therefore to get the total number of electrons in the channel, we integrate over the entire energy range. We have: . $ int_{- infty}^{ infty} frac{D(E)}{t(E)}(f_1(E) - f_2(E)) dE = frac{I}{q}$ . Here we rearranged the equation so that all the energy dependent components are together. . Therefore, we have: . $I = frac {q}{2} int_{- infty}^{ infty} frac{D(E)}{t(E}(f_1(E) - f_2(E)) dE$ . Let us define the conductance as a function of energy G(E) as: . $G(E) = frac{q^2}{2} frac{(D(E)}{t(E)}$ . So we have, . $I = frac{1}{q} int_{- infty}^{ infty} G(E) (f_1(E) - f_2(E)) dE$ .",

            "content": "This is the second lecture . Introduction . This is a short lecture focused on two important concepts that are required for understanding the course. . Density of States . Electrons can only exist in specific energy levels in materials. When it comes to solids, these energy levels form almost continuous bands. It is therefore convenient to define a density of states. This measures the number of states per unit energy. It is obtained experimentally. . Fermi Function . At 0K, the Fermi Level separates the filled states in the energy diagram with the empty states. All energy levels above the Fermi Level are empty and all states below the Fermi Level are occupied. But when the temperature rises above 0K, then this is indicated by the Fermi Function. It indicates, what fraction of the states are filled at each energy level. The Fermi Function is: . $f(E)= frac{1}{1+e ^ frac{E- mu}{kT}}$ . In the above, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature and E is the energy. $kT$ is called the thermal energy and is a universal constant which is ~25 meV. In this scale, energy is measured in meV. . The Fermi Function looks like this: . Coming back to the device, when the two contacts are at the same voltage, we refer to it as the device being in equilibrium. At this state, the picture would be like below: . Here we can see that the two contacts and the channel are at the same electrochemical potential. . When a positive voltage is applied to the drain, the device is no longer in equilibrium. The picture would be like below: . At this stage, the two contacts are shifted with respect to each other. Current flow happens in the region around the Fermi Level where the source has a surplus of electrons while the drain has a deficit. More details about current flow will be presented in future lessons. . NB: Images are from the slides of the class. They are available at nanoHUB. The classes are wonderful, I would highly recommend you go through them. Any mistakes in content are mine. .",

            "content": "This is the first lecture . Introduction . Electronics are becoming smaller and more powerful. This happens as transistor size is decreasing and more and more transistors can be packed into smaller chips. Channels are now a few hundred or less atoms across. It is hard to predict where the technology will be in a few years. Instead, this course focuses on the fundamentals of nanoelectronics which are expected to stand the test of time. . . Conduction . We start with the notion of conduction and conductance. Conduction measures how easily electrons can flow. We define the resistance $R = rho frac{L}{A}$ and the conductance $G = frac{1}{R} = sigma frac{A}{L}$. . $ rho$, resistivity and $ sigma$, conductivity are fundamental properties of the conducting material. . Top-Down Approach . Traditionally, electron flow is modeled as a diffusive process. Here electrons collide with each other in the channel and move from one contact to the other in a random walk. . In this framework, the conductivity $ sigma$ is formulated with the Drude Formula: . $ sigma = frac{q^2n}{m} tau$. . Here $q$ is the charge of the electron, $n$ is the number of free electrons, $ tau$ is the mean free time and $m$ is the effective mass. . Bottom-Up Approach . Here we start with the notion of ballistic transport. This applies to devices where the channel is shorter than the mean free path. This means, there are no collisions and electrons move from one contact to the other like a bullet. . In case of ballistic transport, the conductance is: . $G_B = frac{q^2}{h}M$ . Here $q$ is again the charge of the electron, $h$ is the Planck’s constant and $M$ is the number of modes. It will be described in detail in a later lesson but for now can be considered analogous to the number of lanes in a highway. We can see here that $ frac{q^2}{h}$ is a fundamental constant which is approximately. $ frac{1}{25 kOhm}$. . This conductance can be generalized to bigger devices as well: . $G = G_B frac{ lambda}{L+ lambda} $ . Here $ lambda$ is the mean free path. . In the above equation we can see that if L is much larger than $ lambda$, . $G = G_B frac{ lambda}{L}$ . Comparing this to the original definition of G, we get . $G_B lambda = sigma A$ . Current Flow . To understand current flow in transistors, we need to start with energy diagrams. The source is filled with electrons. Electrons try to move to the lowest possible energy level but due to exclusion, only one electron can occupy a level. This leads to the source having many energy levels with electrons upto a level $ mu_1$ which is the electrochemical potential of the source. The drain also has a similar structure with its own electrochemical potential $ mu_2$ but it is also lowered by the voltage V applied to the drain. Thus its electrochecmical potential is $ mu_2 - qV$. . . Now at the source, it sees a potential difference and it tries to neutralize this by pushing electrons into the channel. At the other end, the drain is at a lowered energy level, it tries to neutralize this by taking electrons from the channel. This leads to current flow. We derive the formula for the conductance later and we get: . $G = frac{q^2D}{2t}$ . Here D is the density of states near the Fermi level and t is the transfer time. . To derive the Drude formula, we start with Newtonian mechanics. . $m frac{dv_d}{dt} = qF - m frac{v_d}{ tau} $ . Here on the LHS is the force defined as $ma$ with $v_d$ being the drift velocity and on the RHS, we have F as the electric field and $m frac{v_d}{ tau}$ is the viscous force due to the material. At steady state, LHS is zero, therefore we have . $v_d = frac{q tau}{m}F$ . $ frac{q tau}{m}$ is considered the mobility. . The current, . $I = Aqnvd = A frac{q^2n tau}{m}F $ . $F = frac{V}{L}$ and therefore we get the Drude formula. . But in this formalism starting with the notion of electric field, it is not clear why all electrons in the contact don’t move across the channel. It is known that only electrons around the Fermi level contribute to the current. It works around this with the concept of free electrons which only exist in the conduction band. Filled bands do not conduct. . Describing current flow in terms of electron flow around the Fermi level leads to both the ballistic and diffusive conductance. The more general diffusive conductance is defined as: . $G = frac{q^2 D bar{D}}{AL} $ . Here $ bar{D}$ is the diffusion coefficient. . Deriving this formula requires advanced formalisms such as the Boltzmann formalism but in our picture, it naturally comes up. This will be done in a later lecture. . Elastic Resistor . We reach this with the concept of an elastic resistor, also known as a Landauer resistor. When electrons travel from one contact to another, there is heat dissipation. It is observed that in case of small devices, where ballistic transport comes into picture, most of the heat is dissipated at the contacts. . Usually, electron motion is a mix of thermodynamics and mechanics. Mechanics is dominated by force driven actions while thermodynamics is dominated by entropy driven actions. To describe electron flow it usually requires combining semi-classical mechanics and entropy driven actions using the Boltzmann Transport Equation. In case of quantum mechanics, it requires combining the Schrodinger equation and entropy driven actions using the Non-equilibrium Green’s Function. . But in case of elastic resistors, this forms almost a clearly separated action, with the thermodynamic forces at the contacts and the mechanical forces dominating at the channel. Thus understanding electron flow is comparatively easier. This can be used for both ballistic and diffusive transport. . In case of big devices, they are modeled as a series of small elastic resistors. So the electron moves elastically from one point to the next, loses some energy, elastically again and so on. Elastic transport means the electron does not lose any energy to the lattice. So even with a diffusive motion, it can be elastic. Ballistic on the other hand means it does lose momentum. The results at low bias match exactly with the Boltzmann formalism. At high bias, we still get a good enough approximation. . The next lecture focuses on the density of states and the Fermi function. . NB: Images are from the slides of the class. They are available at nanoHUB. The classes are wonderful, I would highly recommend you go through them. Any mistakes in content are mine. .",
